AI-Powered Nesting Optimizer

An intelligent nesting optimization tool powered by Artificial Intelligence to minimize material waste in manufacturing and cutting processes. This tool uses advanced algorithms (such as Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, or Deep Learning) to optimally arrange shapes on a sheet or plate for industries like sheet metal, textile, glass, and packaging.

Features

✅ AI-based optimization for minimal material waste
✅ Supports 2D nesting of irregular and rectangular shapes
✅ Customizable for different materials and constraints
✅ Fast computation using heuristics and ML models
✅ Visual representation of nested layouts
✅ Export results as DXF, SVG, or JSON

Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch (for learning-based optimization)

Algorithms: Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, or Reinforcement Learning

Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly

Backend (optional): Flask / FastAPI

Frontend (optional): React.js / Next.js

How It Works

Input:

Material sheet dimensions

Shapes (DXF, SVG, or coordinates)

Constraints (e.g., rotation allowed, gap between shapes)

AI Optimization:

Predicts the best arrangement using optimization algorithms

Output:

Optimal layout with minimal waste

Material utilization percentage

Exportable cutting plan

Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-nesting-optimizer.git
cd ai-nesting-optimizer

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the optimizer:

python main.py --input shapes.json --sheet 2000x1000 --output result.svg


Or with a GUI (if implemented):

python app.py

Example

Input:

{
  "sheet": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000},
  "shapes": [
    {"id": 1, "width": 200, "height": 100},
    {"id": 2, "width": 150, "height": 150},
    {"id": 3, "polygon": [[0,0],[50,0],[25,30]]}
  ]
}


Output:

result.svg showing optimized layout

Material utilization: 92.3%

Future Enhancements
